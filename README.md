# Python Scripting for Financial and Electoral Data Analysis: PyBank & PyPoll Projects

## Overview

This project showcases the application of Python scripting to solve real-world data analysis problems in the finance and election domains. By completing the PyBank and PyPoll challenges, this repository demonstrates the power of Python to automate financial analysis and election vote counting, moving beyond traditional Excel-based methods to handle large datasets efficiently.

### Objectives

- **PyBank:** Analyze financial records to calculate total months, net total amount of "Profit/Losses", average change in "Profit/Losses", greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits.
- **PyPoll:** Modernize a vote-counting process for a small town by analyzing election data to calculate the total number of votes, percentage of votes each candidate won, total number of votes each candidate won, and determining the election winner.

### Methodology

#### PyBank

- Used Python's `csv` module to read the financial dataset.
- Calculated required financial metrics and printed the results to the terminal.
- Exported the analysis to a text file for easy sharing and review.

#### PyPoll

- Employed Python to read election data and performed data analysis to understand voting patterns.
- Calculated total votes, votes per candidate, and determined the winner based on popular vote.
- Results were printed to the terminal and exported to a text file.

### Key Findings

- **PyBank:** Successfully identified financial trends over the given period, highlighting significant increases and decreases in profits that will inform future budgeting decisions.
- **PyPoll:** Demonstrated a comprehensive breakdown of the election results, providing clear insights into voter preferences and the overall election outcome.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Data Exporting:** Initially, the scripts did not export the terminal output to a text file as required. This was addressed by incorporating Python's file writing capabilities to save the analysis results externally.
- **Pandas Usage:** While the feedback noted the use of Pandas, which wasn't covered in the challenge instructions, the primary objectives were still met using basic Python scripting. Future iterations will ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

### Conclusion

This project highlights the versatility of Python in solving data-related challenges across different sectors. Through PyBank and PyPoll, we've demonstrated that Python scripting can enhance the efficiency and depth of data analysis, providing valuable insights that inform strategic decisions.
